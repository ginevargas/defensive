# Problem: You are given a list of strings, where each string represents a sentence. Write a function find_longest_word that takes the list of strings as input and returns the longest word among all the sentences. If there are multiple longest words, return a list containing all of them, in the order they appear. Additionally, ignore any words that are commonly used and have a length of less than 4 characters.

# For example, given the input list ["The quick brown fox", "jumps over the lazy dog"],
# the function should return ["quick", "brown", "jumps"].
